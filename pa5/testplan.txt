	Output for All cases: 
		In all cases the output was exactly as would be expected with appropriate input.
		However, amongst the order confirmations & rejections you will find the following error:
			Order for Really good book neglected. Dropping order.
			Reason: Category HOUSING02 not found.
		An example of this output can be seen in output2.txt

	Correct!
	Input: "Really good book"|11.31|6|HOUSING01 was put in the middle of "orders.txt"
	Correct!
	Input: "Really good book"|11.31|6|HOUSING01 was put at the end of "orders.txt"

Test Case 8: Only one order, Only one UID used, Only one Category used

	Correct!
=============================================================
Test Case 9: Only one order, has an invalid UID
	Input: "Really good book"|11.31|6|HOUSING01 was the only entry in one_order.txt
	Command: ./books database.txt one_order.txt categories.txt

	Correct!
=============================================================
Test Case 10: Only one order, has an invalid category

	Command: ./books database.txt one_order.txt categories.txt
	Output: Gave an invalid category error. See output6.txt
	Correct!
==============================================================
Test Case 11: Regular input
	Input: ./books database.txt orders.txt categories.txt
	Output: Responded as expected. See output.txt
	NOTE: Different users may have different successful/rejected orders on successive runs.
			this is due to the consumer threads running different things in different orders.
	NOTE: My output is identical to the example output except that the orders are arranged
			from most recent to least recent, essentially inverting them. The order in which
			they should be displayed was not specified in the assignment so it was not changed.
	Correct!
